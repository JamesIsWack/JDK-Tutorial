        <h1>Tutorial on how to install JDK on non-Administrator devices.</h1>
        <p>First, download the x64 Windows compressed archive from this <a href="https://download.oracle.com/java/19/latest/jdk-19_windows-x64_bin.zip">link</a></p>
        <p>Next, extract the zip in File Explorer or 7zip. Take the JDK folder that contains the bin, and conf folders (there should be other folders as well).
            Take the path were the bin folder is located, and copy it using CTRL+C. After you do this, go to the Search bar on the taskbar, and type Control Panel. You need to open up the first option, and then go to User Accounts > User Accounts again > Change my system enviorment variables. Add a new variable with the variable name JAVA_HOME</p> 
            <p>Give the new variable a value, and put in the path for the JDK (the path you copied earlier). Make sure to save it by clicking OK. As an example, I have JDK on the root of my C drive, so the variable value is "C:/jdk18/bin" without the quots.</p>
            <p>Thats really all there is to it, however I do reccomend using VS Code as the IDE, but NetBeans is the one provided with the course.</p>
            <p>Speaking of NetBeans, I just thought of something even I had issues with. For some reason, NetBeans wont see the custom USR_VAR we just set, so it had to be defined in a conf. Go to were you have NetBeans installed, for example, it could be in appdata. if it is, type WIN+R on the keyboard, and type appdata in the box that appears. It should open a folder, go inside Local, and look for a NetBeans folder, once inside, go to the etc folder, you should see a couple files, we want the netbeans.conf file. Double click on it, and it should ask what app you want to use. click on "Show more apps" and choose Notepad. Scroll down until you see "#netbeans_jdkhome=" Remove the # and next to the =, type a ", followed by the path that JDK is installed to. Then followed by another ". Then go to File > Save.
