        <h1>Tutorial on how to install JDK on non-Administrator devices.</h1>
        <p>First, download the x64 Windows compressed archive from this <a href="https://download.oracle.com/java/19/latest/jdk-19_windows-x64_bin.zip">link</a></p>
        <p>Next, extract the zip in File Explorer or 7zip. Take the JDK folder that contains the bin, and conf folders (there should be other folders as well).
            Take the path were the bin folder is located, and copy it using CTRL+C. After you do this, go to the Search bar on the taskbar, and type Control Panel. You need to open up the first option, and then go to User Accounts > User Accounts again > Change my system enviorment variables. Add a new variable with the variable name JAVA_HOME</p> 
            <p>Give the new variable a value, and put in the path for the JDK (the path you copied earlier). And make sure to save it by clicking OK. As an example, I have JDK on the root of my C drive, so the variable value is "C:/jdk18/bin" without the quots.</p>
            <p>Thats really all there is too it, however I do reccomend using VS Code as the IDE, but NetBeans is the one provided with the course.</p>
            <p>Much love, </p>
